        <h1> I am planning on attending the University of Maine for the full four years and earning a degree in Business. Although I am still not sure what kind of business I want to major in I am leaning towards finance. After college I hope to see myself having an internship right after my senior year and be working in the business field, wether that being with a bank or another company. </h1>
